# 🌾 Cloud-Based Smart Agriculture Platform 
## 🌐 Live Demo

👉 [Click here to access the deployed app on AWS](http://54.197.141.143:5000/)

A cloud-integrated smart agriculture web platform designed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions for optimal crop yield. It offers crop recommendations based on user inputs such as state, season, and soil type using a trained machine learning model, along with access to weather forecasts and farming insights.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 **Crop Recommendation System** (powered by ML)
- 🗺️ **Crop Suggestions based on N, P, K, Temp, Humidity, Rain**
- 🧪 Soil Type-Based Filtering
- ☁️ Cloud-based Deployment (e.g., AWS)
- 📁 Easy Dataset Integration & Model Updates

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input Collection:** Farmers provide their state, soil type, and current season.
2. **Model Prediction:** A trained machine learning model predicts the most suitable crops.
3. **Cloud Services:** Cloud infrastructure handles backend ML prediction, storage, and scaling.
4. **Frontend:** A responsive UI displays results, tips, and weather forecasts.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI)
- **ML Model:** Scikit-learn
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Crop Recommendation Dataset
- **Deployment:** AWS
